    Chunked-Prefill Scheduling policy

    The prefill vs. decode priority policy is the following:
        - Current prefill request priority: A new request cannot start prefill
           while another request's prefill is on-going

        - Prefill step interleaving: The prefill steps are interleaved with
            one decode step: as long as there are decoding requests, two
            prefill steps cannot be consecutive

        - General prefill priority: conditioned on interleaving constraint,
            prefill has priority over decode

        - No empty step: if a prefill step is prevented because it doesn't
            satisfy Spyre's specific constraints, a decode step is scheduled

    Spyre scheduling constraints:

        - Prefill batch size: prefill batch is of size 1, only one request's
            chunked prefill can be scheduled at a time

        - Decode batch size: cannot have more than max_num_seqs running
            requests, including prefill and decode

        Note: all the remaining constraints need to be satisfied at the time
            of scheduling the last chunk of a chunked prefill

        - Max model length constraint: the number of requested tokens must fit
            between the maximum TKV of all the running requests and the end of
            the model's context

        - Volumetric constraint: the total "surface" defined by the running
            requests should never exceed `VLLM_DT_MAX_BATCH_TKV_LIMIT`. See
            `check_batch_tkv_limit()` method for details.

        - The surface defined by the maximum TKV of
            all the running requests and the number of running requests must
            not exceed the limit defined by `VLLM_DT_MAX_BATCH_TKV_LIMIT`

        Check whether adding a new sequence to the decode batch would violate
        Spyre's maximum batch volume constraint for chunked prefill.

        In Spyre, the product of `batch_size` and the current `tkv`
        (tokens-per-sequence) must not exceed the limit defined by
        `VLLM_DT_MAX_BATCH_TKV_LIMIT`. Before scheduling a new sequence,
        we must ensure that this constraint will hold for all decoding
        steps that result from combining the new sequence with the currently
        running decode batch.

        This implementation:
        1. Computes the maximum possible `tkv` for each sequence in the
        decode batch.
        2. Sorts these values in ascending order.
        3. Iterates through them, stopping once the `tkv` of the new sequence.
        is reached. Remaining sequences do not need to be checked explicitly,
        since they were validated when they were added (by inductive reasoning).

        Note: drawing explaining the algorithm in more detail uploaded here:
